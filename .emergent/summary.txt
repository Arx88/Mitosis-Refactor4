The previous AI engineer, E1, initiated work on the Mitosis application, a full-stack React/FastAPI/MongoDB project. The initial phase involved setting up the environment by executing  and then thoroughly exploring the codebase to understand its structure and existing functionalities. E1 then proceeded to address three core user-reported issues: the intelligent task title not updating, the action plan timer resetting, and critical task isolation problems where components like chat, action plan, and terminal were not independent per task. E1 made several targeted fixes in , , and implicitly in  or related frontend components. Despite these fixes, some issues persisted or new symptoms appeared, such as the task header still displaying a generic title (Tarea 1), the action plan panel not appearing, and WebSocket disconnections linked to conflicting task IDs. The user then explicitly instructed E1 to perform a more comprehensive code review, emphasizing logical and coherent solutions, leading E1 to begin a systematic re-analysis of key frontend components (, ) and the WebSocket code before further modifications.

<product_requirements>
The Mitosis application is a full-stack project using React, FastAPI, and MongoDB, designed to function as a general agent. The primary issues to be resolved and improvements to be implemented are:
1.  **Application Startup:** Ensure the application successfully runs by executing .
2.  **Smart Task Titles:** Fix a bug where the intelligent task title, generated by an existing LLM function in the backend (), is not correctly displayed in the frontend header (e.g., it defaults to Tarea 1 instead of the enhanced title).
3.  **Action Plan Timer Stability:** Correct the active step timer within the PLAN DE ACCION panel, which currently resets prematurely before stabilizing, indicating an issue with its counting mechanism.
4.  **Task Isolation:** Address a critical architectural flaw where the CHAT, PLAN DE ACCION, and TERMINAL CONSOLE (TASKVIEW COMPLETO) are not independent. When a new task is created, the components from previous tasks remain active, causing severe context leakage. The solution must ensure these views are isolated per task.
5.  **Codebase Refinement:** Conduct a thorough review of the entire codebase to eliminate deprecated code, prevent duplication, and implement better software practices to ensure a logical and coherent architecture for the general agent application.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-stack Development:** React (frontend), FastAPI (backend), MongoDB (database).
-   **Environment Configuration:** Strict usage of  and  from  files.
-   **API Communication:** Backend endpoints prefixed with , handling REST and WebSocket interactions.
-   **State Management:** React hooks (, , ) for managing application state.
-   **LLM Integration:** Utilization of Large Language Models (e.g., Ollama) for generating intelligent task titles.
-   **Process Management:** Supervisor for managing backend and frontend services.

<code_architecture>
The application's directory structure is organized into  (FastAPI) and  (React), with common project files at the root.



**Key Files and Changes:**

*   :
    *   **Importance:** This file defines the backend API endpoints. Specifically, the  endpoint processes new tasks and integrates with the  function to create intelligent task titles.
    *   **Changes:** No explicit code modifications were shown in the trajectory; the AI focused on understanding how  is generated and returned from here.
*   :
    *   **Importance:** This custom hook manages the state and logic for the PLAN DE ACCION component, including starting/completing steps and handling timers. It was identified as the source of the timer resetting issue due to complex, overlapping timeouts.
    *   **Changes:** The AI made several edits to simplify the , , and  functions to resolve the timer's erratic behavior.
*   :
    *   **Importance:** This component renders the core user interface for an active task, including the chat, action plan, and terminal. It is critical for ensuring task isolation.
    *   **Changes:** The AI modified this file to improve task isolation by enhancing the state reset mechanism when a new task is initiated.
*   :
    *   **Importance:** The main application component, responsible for orchestrating the different views and handling data flow from the backend, including receiving the .
    *   **Changes:** While not explicitly detailed, the AI likely made (or intended to make) changes here or in closely related components to ensure the  received from the backend is correctly displayed in the task header. This fix was partially successful (sidebar title updated) but not fully (header still showed Tarea 1).
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   **Smart Title Display:** Fully resolve why the intelligent task title is not appearing in the main task header despite being partially updated in the sidebar.
-   **Action Plan Display:** Fix the issue where the PLAN DE ACCIÃ“N panel is not appearing correctly.
-   **WebSocket Connectivity & Task ID Conflicts:** Stabilize the WebSocket connection (currently offline) and resolve conflicts between frontend and backend task IDs.
-   **Comprehensive Code Refinement:** Perform a thorough code review to eliminate deprecated code, avoid duplication, and ensure a logical and coherent architecture as per user instruction.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was in the process of conducting a comprehensive and systematic re-analysis of the application's codebase. This decision was made after initial attempts to fix the smart title, timer, and task isolation issues proved partially effective but did not fully resolve all reported problems, leading the user to request a deeper, more holistic understanding of the code.

The current work involves:
1.  **Reviewing **: Re-examining  to understand the main application flow and how tasks are initiated and managed at a high level.
2.  **Reviewing **: Analyzing  to understand the terminal component's state management and how it interacts with tasks, especially regarding isolation.
3.  **Preparing WebSocket Code Review**: The next immediate step indicated by the AI is to review the WebSocket code. This is critical because the logs revealed successful WebSocket connection upgrades but also conflicting task IDs, suggesting that the problem might lie in how these IDs are used or propagated between the frontend and backend, impacting overall task isolation and real-time updates for the plan and terminal.

The goal is to map the entire flow to identify the root causes of the persistent bugs, particularly the task isolation, plan display, and WebSocket stability issues, to develop a coherent and robust solution.

Continue the comprehensive code analysis, focusing on the WebSocket implementation to understand and resolve the OFFLINE status and task ID conflicts.
