The AI engineer's work primarily focused on debugging and refactoring the PLAN DE ACCION logic in a React frontend with a FastAPI/Flask backend. Initial steps involved identifying the application's structure and successfully running it via . The core problem was a loop infinito in the plan's state updates, caused by multiple event handlers and state modifications leading to inconsistent UI behavior. The engineer attempted a refactor by creating a new  hook and modifying , introducing debouncing and hash comparison for state updates. However, the loop reappeared, indicating the previous fix was incomplete. The latest interaction reveals the root cause to be orphaned files from an older plan system conflicting with the refactored one. The AI engineer is currently poised to clean up these conflicting files.

<product_requirements>
The user requires fixing and refactoring the PLAN DE ACCION logic within the application's interface. The current issues are:
1.  **Duplication and Overcomplication:** The code is perceived as overly complex with redundant logic.
2.  **Inconsistent State:** Multiple event handlers are overriding each other, causing the  state to glitch.
3.  **Visual Glitches:** Only the first step displays correctly as active; subsequent steps show a mixed state (blue box without spinner/tick), appearing as a blend of active and completed.
4.  **Desired Behavior:** When a step is completed, the *next* step should immediately become active.
The overarching goal is to simplify and make the code effective without altering the existing UI or UX, specifically ensuring correct state transitions (pending, active, completed) and visual indicators.

**Key Files and Changes:**

-   :
    -   **Importance:** This is the main React component responsible for rendering the PLAN DE ACCION and interacting with the plan management logic.
    -   **Changes Made:**
        -   Initially, an  in this file caused an infinite loop by reacting to  updates that it itself triggered.
        -   The dependency  was removed from the .
        -   Logic for hash comparison was added to  to prevent unnecessary updates.

-   :
    -   **Importance:** This was identified as an older/conflicting plan management hook that contributed to the duplication and state issues.
    -   **Changes Made:** The trajectory indicates this file was initially examined, and the overall goal was to move away from its logic. While the trajectory does not explicitly show direct modifications to this file, the troubleshooting step explicitly mentions it as an orphaned file contributing to conflicts, implying it needs to be removed or its usage discontinued.

-   :
    -   **Importance:** This is the newly created/refactored hook intended to centralize and correctly manage the state of the PLAN DE ACCION.
    -   **Changes Made:**
        -   Implemented a 100ms debounce mechanism to prevent frequent updates.
        -   Integrated hash comparison to avoid redundant state updates.
        -   Added an  flag to prevent simultaneous updates.
        -   Improved cleanup logic for timeouts and references.

-   :
    -   **Importance:** This file was read to understand its context within the application, as  imported it. While no changes were explicitly mentioned in the trajectory, it was part of the exploration to understand the interconnectedness of the plan management system.

<pending_tasks>
-   The user reported a glitcheo (glitch/flickering) in the action panel which indicates an ongoing loop/state issue.
-   The previous AI engineer confirmed the loop is back and identified orphaned files from the old system as the cause.
-   The immediate pending task is to clean up these conflicting old files.
-   There's also a separate, not yet addressed, issue with task persistence: la tarea ya no aparece en el sidebar, parece que hay algún problema con la persistencia de las tareas.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer had completed a first attempt at refactoring the PLAN DE ACCION logic. This involved:
1.  **Creating/Updating **: This new hook was intended to be the single source of truth for plan state, incorporating debounce and hash comparison to optimize updates and prevent loops.
2.  **Modifying **: The  hook was adjusted to remove  from its dependencies and integrate with the new  to prevent rendering loops.

However, after these changes were applied and the frontend was restarted, the user reported that the glitcheo (flickering/glitching) was back, and debug logs confirmed an infinite loop was still occurring ( and  logs repeatedly). This indicated that the previous fix was incomplete.

The AI engineer then used a troubleshooter agent, which identified the root cause: Hay archivos huérfanos del sistema viejo que están causando el conflicto. This means remnants of the old plan management system (likely  and related components) are still active or conflicting with the new , leading to the persistent loop. The current work halted just before the AI engineer was about to proceed with cleaning up these identified orphaned files.
